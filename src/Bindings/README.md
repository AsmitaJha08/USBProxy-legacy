USBProxy Language Bindings
==========================

Status
------
Only packet filter plugins can be written in Python so far. Other plugins and
languages will be supported in the near future.

Usage
-----
The Python code here uses Python 3. This is partly because FaceDancer uses 
Python 3 and we want to be compatible with their applications. It's also
because it's 2014, let's stop using Python 2.

License
-------
All files should have a license displayed at the start of the file.  Any code
that we have written is released under the GPL v3 license.
